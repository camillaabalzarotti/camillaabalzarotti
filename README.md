## Hi there 👋

My name is **Camilla Balzarotti** and I'm currently about to start my second year of Masters in **Bioengineering of Information** at Politecnico of Milano, where I also completed my Bachelor degree in **Computer Science and Engineering** with the maximum grade, **110 cum laude**.

As part of my academic journey, I spent an **Erasmus exchange at the University of Twente**, broadening my expertise in deep learning applied to biomedical signal and image processing. 

🎯 My intention for the future is to pursue a **PhD in AI for medical applications**, where I can further develop innovative methods for image and signal analysis in healthcare.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Medicine**, with a focus on:  
- **Medical Image Analysis** (MRI, CT, fundus images, lesion/tumor segmentation)  
- **Biomedical Signal Processing** (EEG, physiological signals, haptics)  
- **AI- and ML-driven decision support systems** for healthcare

**🔧 Skills**
- Programming: Python, C, MATLAB, C++, Java  
- Tools: Unity, ROS, TensorFlow, PyTorch  
- Areas: Machine Learning, Medical Imaging, Signal Processing, Robotics

This GitHub profile serves as a **personal portfolio of my projects**, documenting my progress and contributions.
